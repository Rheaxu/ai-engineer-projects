This reduces $n$ from **262,144** to just **4,096**, making the $n^2$ calculation significantly cheaper.\n",

Standard attention tries to write the entire $n \\times n$ matrix to the GPU's High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). **FlashAttention** breaks the matrix into smaller blocks and calculates them in the GPU's fast cache (SRAM), meaning the giant bottleneck matrix never actually has to exist in its full form in the main VRAM.\n",

        "### C. Tiled VAE & Windowed Attention\n",
        "* **Tiled VAE:** If an image is too large to decode at once, the model breaks it into overlapping \"tiles,\" processes them individually, and stitches them back together.\n",
        "* **Windowed/Local Attention:** Instead of every pixel looking at every other pixel in the entire image, pixels only look at their immediate neighbors (a local window). This changes the math from **Quadratic** ($O(n^2)$) to **Linear** ($O(n)$).\n",
